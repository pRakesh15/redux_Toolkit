    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Here's a brief guide on how to use Redux Toolkit in this project.

### Creating a Slice

A slice is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature of your app. Here's an example of how to create a slice:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
